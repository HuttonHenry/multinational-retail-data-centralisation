Code created using Python 

Uses SQL Alchemy for SQL connectivity
https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/engines.html
pip install sqlalchemy


Postgres Connection
I needed to change the YAML file, as it used the same variable for both the postgres database type and databaase name, but the type had changed to 'postgresql'.  

I also had to install <conda install psycopg2>
